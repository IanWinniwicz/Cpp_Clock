 - This project was to build a 12 hour clock along with a 24 hour clock that accepts user input to set a time on each clock.

What did you do particularly well?
- What I did well on this project was 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- I found the loops challenging to write but after reading documentation they became a lot easier. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- skills from this project that will be transerable to other projects or course work are incrementation and looping.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- spacing out functions and loops, also commenting.
